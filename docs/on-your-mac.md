# What Threadbear does on your Mac

Everything Threadbear installs, runs in the background, reads, and talks to
over the network. It's here so you, or the agent installing it for you, can
check the code against it before running anything. If the code does
something that isn't on this list, treat that as a problem and say so.
File references are where to look.

## What setup and install add

- **Git remotes** (`scripts/setup.mjs`, "Your copy"): Mike's repo becomes
  `upstream`. If `gh` is logged in and you cloned rather than forked, setup
  forks the repo to your GitHub account (`gh repo fork --remote`).
- **Packages:** `npm ci` in the repo, in `runner/`, and in each runner
  release. esbuild and fsevents have install scripts.
- **Convex, in your own account:** a login (`~/.convex/config.json`), a
  project with a production deployment, a deploy key, and one environment
  variable (`RUNNER_KEY`). It deploys `convex/` and the `web/` site there.
  If that login goes missing or expires, the Convex panel's Sign in to
  Convex button runs `convex login` again from the runner, which writes
  the same file; you approve it in your browser on auth.convex.dev.
- **Apps:** `~/Applications/Threadbear.app` and
  `~/Applications/Threadbear Runner.app`, both built and signed on your Mac.
- **A LaunchAgent:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner.plist`,
  which keeps the runner going while you're logged in. A runner on a Linux
  server (INSTALL.md, section 6) has a systemd user service in its place,
  `~/.config/systemd/user/com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner.service`, and no
  apps; it converts pictures with ImageMagick and rsvg-convert, and reads
  the account's full name from `getent passwd` rather than `id -F`.
- **A command:** `~/.local/bin/threadbear`.
- **Files:** the data folder `~/Library/Application Support/Threadbear`
  (threads, settings, `secrets/`, runner releases, the pinned release key
  `upstream-signers`, and `sync-sent.json`, hashes of what's already in your
  Convex mirror so a restart sends only what changed, and
  `shared-pools.json`, the last pools your Convex backend had, which every
  runner shares, so one starts with them while the backend can't be reached). In `secrets/`, `asked/` holds the answers you
  type into an agent's secret card, one owner-only file each with a small
  script beside it that prints it for `sudo -A`, removed after 24 hours,
  and `secret-box.key` is the key your phone seals those answers to;
  `runners/<id>.token` is another Mac's runner token, if you copied one
  in, and `runners/<id>.host` beside it, which you copy in too (`tb pair`
  on that Mac prints both): the only host the app sends that token to.
  The app only reads these; with no `.host` it sends the token nowhere;
  `~/Library/Caches/Threadbear/update`;
  `~/Library/Caches/Threadbear/remote` (copies of pictures and files from
  threads on your other Macs, at most 512 MB, unused ones go after 30 days);
  `~/Library/Logs/threadbear-runner.log` and `threadbear-update.log`;
  `~/Library/Logs/Threadbear/hangs` (the last 10 times the app froze: if its
  main thread is stuck for 4 seconds it runs macOS's `sample` on itself, in
  a sandbox, and
  nothing else ever reads these); and `~/ThreadbearThreads`, the default
  folder for new threads. A folder you open from a link in the side pane
  is listed, and watched for changes only while it's showing, and macOS may
  ask for permission the first time that's somewhere like Documents. The runner also runs `ps`, and `sample` (in a
  sandbox, through `sandbox-exec`) on a thread's own CLI, when a turn has been quiet for a minute,
  to tell a CLI frozen on a macOS prompt from a long job. The sample is a
  temp file, deleted straight after. `mac-screen.json` in the data folder
  remembers what it's said about dialogs on the screen (below).

Voice mode, the first time you use it (Settings > Voice, or the
waveform button beside Send), downloads Kyutai's pocket-tts (v4.0.1, its
Apple silicon build, checked against its SHA-256 before it's used) from
its GitHub release into `~/Library/Application Support/Threadbear/voice/`,
with its log `serve.log` beside it. pocket-tts then downloads its English
model and voices from Hugging Face into `~/.cache/huggingface` (about
240 MB; another language is another model). macOS asks once for the
microphone, and may download its own speech recognition files for the
language (`app/Sources/Threadbear/Voice/`). The bear at the top right of the sidebar, the first time it's clicked,
makes `~/ThreadbearThreads/Bear` with a `CLAUDE.md` of instructions for
its chats (never rewritten once it's there); Claude Code keeps the bear's
memory for that folder in `~/.claude/projects/`, as it does for any folder.
`~/Library/Logs/Threadbear/voice.log`
notes what Voice did (which microphone, whether echo cancellation
started, errors), never what was said, and is started afresh past 256 KB.

## What runs in the background

- **The runner** listens on `127.0.0.1:8797` only, and needs a token
  (`runner/src/config.ts`). It starts the official `claude` and `codex`
  CLIs for your threads.
- **Agents get full access by default.** Claude runs with
  `bypassPermissions` and Codex with `danger-full-access`. "Ask before
  edits" is a choice for each thread.
- **Your phone and browser can drive the Mac.** A paired iPhone or a
  signed-in browser can start threads in any folder, send messages and
  answer approvals, through your Convex deployment (`runner/src/sync.ts`).
  Those threads start on full access like any other, so treat a pairing like
  a login to the Mac, and so is admin access to your Convex deployment.
  Pairings last 90 days unless set otherwise, at most 365
  (`convex/tokens.ts`); Revoke in Settings › Phone & browser ends one.
- **Following your main** (`runner/src/update.ts`, `app/Sources/Threadbear/AppUpdate.swift`):
  the runner and the app watch your local `main`, and look again every 5
  minutes. Within seconds of it changing, they rebuild themselves from it
  and redeploy your backend, so whatever reaches your `main` runs, with no
  signature check; only Mike's release tags are signed (below). Turn it
  off for both with `followMain: false` in `runner.json` (ask any thread
  to; it left Settings on 2 Nov).
- **Mike's releases** (`runner/src/upstream.ts`): every 6 hours it fetches
  `upstream`'s signed `release/*` tags. It only tells you about them; it
  never changes your code.
- **CLI updates** (`runner/src/updates/`): every hour it checks for new
  Claude Code and Codex versions and installs them. If you don't point it
  at your own Codex, it installs one into the data folder.
  `THREADBEAR_CLI_UPDATES=off` stops this.
- **Small model calls** (`runner/src/models/`): thread titles, filing
  threads into projects (the librarian, every 5 minutes) and similar jobs
  send short excerpts of your threads to `claude -p` on your own logins.
  When a project's notes pass 12,000 characters, the librarian sends them
  the same way to be rewritten shorter, and keeps the old notes in the
  data folder's `project-notes/` (the last 5 for each project).
- **Housekeeping** (`runner/src/housekeeping.ts`): trims logs and deletes
  old pasted images, trash and archived threads' media.
- **Presence** (`runner/src/presence.ts`): reads how long the keyboard and
  mouse have been idle (`ioreg`), so your phone knows whether you're at
  the Mac.
- **Dialogs on the screen** (`runner/src/mac-screen.ts`): every 2 minutes it
  runs `osascript` to count the windows of macOS's UserNotificationCenter, so
  it can tell you when a dialog has been left waiting. It sees how many, not
  what they say. `THREADBEAR_MAC_SCREEN=off` stops it.
- **Patches** (`.threadbear/patches/`): code from a folder runs only after
  you trust that folder (`runner/src/patch-trust.ts`). A folder's Claude
  Code hooks, other commands and `env` settings in its
  `.claude/settings*.json`, and its `.mcp.json` servers, are held back the
  same way (`runner/src/claude-trust.ts`):
  the runner reads those files and the scripts they name to hash them,
  and keeps what you trusted in the same `patch-trust.json`.
- **Voice** (`app/Sources/Threadbear/Voice/VoiceServer.swift`): only
  while Voice is in use and for 5 minutes after, the app runs
  `pocket-tts serve` on a free port on 127.0.0.1 (not reachable from other
  machines), sends it each reply's sentences and plays what comes back.
  It stops when the app quits. While Voice is on, the microphone is on,
  and what you say is turned into text on this Mac by macOS's own speech
  recognition (SpeechAnalyzer); the audio isn't saved or sent anywhere.
  The text goes to the thread as your message.
- **Menus on macOS 27.2** (`app/Sources/Threadbear/DragSpace.swift`): every
  5 seconds, and before a button opens a menu, the app asks the window
  server which Spaces its own windows are on, and takes them off the drag
  Space a window drag can leave them on, which hides their menus. A window
  filed under another display's Space than the one it's on (after a
  restart in the background) is put on its own display's. These are
  private window server calls, and they only touch the app's own windows.

## What it reads

- From your Claude and Codex logins: which account each is (the email in
  `~/.claude.json`), a few settings, and the token counts in your session
  transcripts, so it can show how much room each login has
  (`runner/src/accounts.ts`, `runner/src/token-tally.ts`;
  `THREADBEAR_TOKEN_TALLY=off` stops the counting). It never reads or
  copies login tokens or the Keychain.
- Token Stats' files, if you have that app, and any logins you've added
  under `accounts` in its data folder (`claude-1`, `codex-1`...).
- Your first name, from your Mac account's full name (`id -F`), so its
  agents know what to call you (`runner/src/user-name.ts`). It stays in
  the instructions your own threads get.
- Whether it has Full Disk Access, by opening macOS's permissions database
  (`~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`) and closing it
  again. It never reads it. Without the access macOS refuses, with no prompt.
- Whether `Threadbear.app` is in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`, as a Mac
  without it is probably one nobody sits at.

## Who it talks to

| Service | Whose | What goes there |
|---|---|---|
| Your Convex deployment | yours | Thread titles and status, all message text (each message cut at 8,000 characters), one line per tool call, projects, schedules, your logins' emails and usage, whether you're at the Mac. Photos you send from the phone, deleted once the Mac has fetched them. Pictures and videos agents put in their replies or pin, at most 10 MB each, for the phone to show. Other images only for threads you share by link. Other tool output and files stay on the Mac. |
| Convex (the Convex panel) | yours | Only for a thread in a Convex project, when its Convex panel opens: the runner's Convex CLI asks api.convex.dev for the project's deployments and a deploy key, the runner asks the deployment whether a kept key still works (`/api/check_admin_key`), and the panel loads Convex's embedded dashboard (dashboard-embedded.convex.dev) with that key. Sign in to Convex goes to auth.convex.dev. (`runner/src/convex-keys.ts`) |
| GitHub | Mike's repo | Release tags fetched every 6 hours; the fork at setup |
| downloads.claude.ai, registry.npmjs.org | Anthropic, npm | CLI version checks and installs; `npm ci` |
| Anthropic, OpenAI | yours | Your threads, through the official CLIs on your own logins. After a turn fails because the API couldn't be reached, the runner itself opens (and straight away closes) a connection to api.anthropic.com or chatgpt.com on port 443, at most once a minute, until one opens and the thread carries on. Nothing is sent over it (`runner/src/net-probe.ts`). |
| Mike's push relay | Mike's | Only when a paired iPhone gets a notification. It's sent from your Convex deployment, not the Mac. The text is encrypted for the phone; the relay sees the device token and thread id (`convex/push.ts`, `docs/push-relay.md`). The first time, your deployment registers with it, giving its own address; the relay keeps that address and checks it by posting a one-time code back to your deployment's `/relay/verify` (`convex/http.ts`). |
| A Connectors gateway | whoever runs it | Only if one is set in `runner.json` or `~/.claude.json`. Its `/health` every few minutes, and for a project with a Notion page, a Notion read or two every 5 minutes for its task board (`runner/src/notion-tasks.ts`), signed with the header the `headersHelper` command in that `connectors` entry prints, which it runs for each read |
| GitHub, Hugging Face | Kyutai's | Only the first time Voice is used: the pocket-tts download, then its model and voices. Nothing of yours is sent. |
| Sentry | Mike's | Nothing from your copy. Only a copy whose `origin` is Mike's own repo reports errors or uploads the app's debug symbols (`runner/src/sentry.ts`, `app/Sources/Threadbear/CrashReporting.swift`, `app/build-app.sh`). The App Store iPhone app sends anonymous crash reports. |

On the Mac itself, a web link you click in the app first goes to
BrowserBear's socket (`~/Library/Application Support/BrowserBear/browserbear.sock`),
if you have BrowserBear, to ask whether an agent's Chrome tab is already
on that page (`app/Sources/Threadbear/BrowserBear.swift`). Only the link
goes there.

With BrowserBear's agent Chrome (`browserbear ... --profile agent`, started only
when an agent asks for it), the Browser panel reads `agent/tabs.json` in BrowserBear's
folder and connects to that Chrome's debugging port on 127.0.0.1, for the picture of
the page and to send your mouse and keys. It never touches your own Chrome or its
profiles. That Chrome is real Google Chrome with its own profile folder, also in BrowserBear's
folder, and any program on this Mac could reach its port, so it holds only what you sign it in to
(`app/Sources/Threadbear/Views/AgentBrowserPanel.swift`).

Nothing else: no analytics, no ads, no tracking.
