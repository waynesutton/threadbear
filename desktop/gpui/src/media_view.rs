// Videos and PDFs in the Mac's own views (native/media_views.m): AVKit's
// player and PDFKit's view, over a GPUI layout slot, as the Swift app's pane
// (FilePreviewView, Quick Look) and review window (ReviewVideo) show them.
// GPUI has no video player, and the web runtime's Chromium has no H.264, so
// on a Mac the system's own views do it; on Windows and Linux a video or a
// PDF still opens in its own app, through the open gate.
//
// A view is made the first time its slot is drawn, through the open gate
// (`open_gate::show_media`, the only way one is made), and then placed by its
// window once a frame after everything's laid out (`sweeper`), as the web
// panels' pages are (web_panels.rs): where its slot was drawn that frame, and
// hidden while a dialog, a sheet or one of the app's menus could be over it,
// as GPUI can't draw over a native view. A slot that isn't drawn in a frame
// has gone (the preview closed, another thread or shot is showing, the pane
// was put away), so its view stops and goes then, as a SwiftUI view's
// dismantle stops the Swift app's.
//
// Kept in thread-locals rather than an entity: the views are the main
// thread's, and a slot drawn while an entity is being updated never has to
// read that entity back (a double lease).
