Feature: Design reviews
  As someone an agent shows design options to (its show_options)
  I want them in a window of their own, big enough to compare
  So I can step through them, tick one or several, say why and send it

  # The demo thread's review has four options, each one picture: A, B and C to
  # pick from, C the agent's pick, and D for reference only.
  Background:
    Given the app is connected to a runner with the demo threads
    When I open the thread "Compare account picker designs"

  Scenario: A review: link in the agent's reply opens that review
    When I follow the link "review:review_account" in the agent's last reply

  # An ask's link is followed from inside the composer's own update, and the

  # Voice Type puts what Mike says on the clipboard and presses ⌘V in the
