Feature: Diagram Prints
  As someone keeping diagrams with a project or a thread
  I want to edit their source and keep the previous versions
  So the diagram stays useful after the reply that made it

  # The demo-runner driver does not seed local Prints yet. These flows
  # are checked with an isolated dev runner until that driver supports them.

  Scenario: Edit a diagram's source and keep the preceding version
    Given a diagram Print called "Task flow" contains Mermaid source
    When I choose Edit Text from that Print's menu
    Then the editor shows its Mermaid source
    When I change the source and save it
    Then the diagram redraws as a new version marked edited by you
    And its preceding version can still be opened and restored

  @prints.diagram @manual @gpui-pending
  Scenario: A malformed source edit keeps the current diagram
    Given a diagram Print called "Task flow" has a saved version
    When I save malformed Mermaid source in its Edit Text editor
    Then an error explains that the diagram could not be rendered
    And the current diagram and its version remain unchanged

  @prints.diagram @manual @gpui-pending
  Scenario: A diagram remains accessible without a project
    Given a diagram Print was created in a thread with no project
    When I reopen its card in that thread
    Then I can open the diagram and edit its source
    And assigning it to a project lists the same Print there

  @prints.whenasked @manual @gpui-pending
  Scenario: Only make Prints when I ask holds back a Print nobody asked for
    Given Prints is on and "Only make Prints when I ask" is on in Settings
    When a thread goes to make a Print after a message that asks for none
    Then an approval card asks "Make the print" with its title first
    When I choose No on that card
    Then no Print is made and the thread is told I said no
    When I ask a thread to "make a chart of this data"
    Then it makes the Print without a card

  @prints.pane @manual @gpui-pending
  Scenario: A Print opened from its card follows new versions in the side pane
    Given a reply in a thread shows a Print's card at version 1
    When I click Open on the card
    Then the Print opens in the thread's side pane
    When the thread saves version 2 of that Print
    Then the side pane shows version 2 without another click
