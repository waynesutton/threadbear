// Mike's standing instructions for every session (docs/protocol.md,
// "Standing instructions"): what every thread's agent should keep in mind,
// on every login, Claude and Codex alike. After Wayne Sutton's PR.
//
// They go into the brief of every future session in every folder, including
// threads that ask before they do anything, so writing them is a way for one
// thread to steer all the others. So the file alone doesn't count: only what
// instructions.set saved does, bound by an HMAC keyed by the runner's RPC
// token, as it was when the runner started. A plain hash beside the file would only catch a careless edit, as
// anything that can write the file can write the hash; with the token,
// signing a file takes exactly what calling instructions.set takes, so
// there's one thing to protect and one line to draw (the protocol doc has
// where it stops, on Full access). It's the token the RPC server took at
// startup, never the file read again: a thread that can write but not read
// could otherwise replace secrets/runner-token and pick the key (Codex
// review), or leave a FIFO there and hang the runner on the next message.
