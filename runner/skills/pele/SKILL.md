description: Draw Mermaid diagrams with Pele, which renders Mermaid text to a clean SVG and an HTML page. Use this whenever someone asks for a Mermaid diagram or any chart-like diagram that Mermaid can express - flowchart, sequence diagram, class, state, ER or database schema, Gantt or timeline, user journey, mind map, pie, quadrant, git graph, architecture or C4, sankey, XY chart, kanban - including "diagram this flow", "draw the architecture", "show the schema", "make a chart of". When it's unclear whether a diagram or a machine illustration is wanted, use this. Not for illustrations of how a physical machine or mechanism works (an engine, a lock, a watch, an isometric explainer): the anatomy skill is for those.

# Pele: Mermaid diagrams

Pele (https://pele.run, MIT, by Obsidian) renders every Mermaid 12.1.0 diagram
type to SVG with its own clean layout. It's installed in this skill's folder
(`node_modules/pele`), so nothing is downloaded and nothing leaves the Mac.

## Making a diagram

1. Write the Mermaid source to a `.mmd` file where the work belongs: the
   project's `docs/`, or the thread's folder for a one-off. Name it for what
   it shows (`checkout-flow.mmd`).
2. Render it with the script in this skill's folder (the base directory you
   were given for this skill):

   ```sh
   node "<this skill's folder>/render.mjs" path/to/checkout-flow.mmd --title "Checkout flow"
   ```

   It writes `checkout-flow.html` (light and dark, with the source folded
   under it) and `checkout-flow.svg` next to the `.mmd`, and prints their
   paths. If Pele can't parse the source it exits 1 with the reason: fix the
   Mermaid and run it again.
3. Show it. In Threadbear, pin the HTML page with `show: true` so it opens in
   the side panel beside the thread. Elsewhere, give the path to the HTML (or
   the SVG for docs).
4. In your reply, say in a sentence what the diagram shows. Put the Mermaid
   source in a ```mermaid block only if they asked for the source, or it's
   going into a README or docs that draw Mermaid themselves (GitHub does).

## Tips

- In Threadbear, when the user asks to keep a diagram as a Print, use `create_print({ title, summary, mermaid: source })` or `update_print` instead. The runner renders it, keeps editable source and SVG, and gives it versions and project membership. Read the existing Print before changing it so user edits are preserved. The renderer is bundled, so this path needs no package install.
- Keep labels short; put detail in the reply, not the boxes.
- `flowchart LR` reads well for pipelines, `TD` for hierarchies.
- To change a diagram, edit the `.mmd` and render again; the page updates in place.
