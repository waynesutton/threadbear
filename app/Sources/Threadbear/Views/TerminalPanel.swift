///
/// Each thread has a shell of its own, started in the thread's folder (its
/// worktree when it has one) and kept running while you look at other
/// threads, so switching back finds it as you left it. A thread on another
/// Mac or the cloud gets a shell on this Mac in your home folder, with a
/// line saying so, as its folder isn't here. With no thread open it's a
/// shell in your home folder too.
///
/// A thread can have several shells, as tabs along the top with + for
/// another, so a dev server keeps running in one while you work in the
/// next (Wayne, 8 Nov). A shell that exits closes its tab while others
/// are open; the last one says it has exited, with New Shell.
///
/// A shell only starts when you ask for one: ⌘J, clicking the empty
/// panel, or a ```bash block's play icon. Clicking through threads with the panel open, or launching with
/// it left open, starts nothing, as each login shell reads your whole
/// profile. A thread's shell stops when the thread is archived or deleted
/// (a dev server left running there would otherwise keep going in a
/// worktree the next thread gets), and every shell stops when the app quits.
