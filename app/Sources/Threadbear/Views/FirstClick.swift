// macOS swallows the click that brings a window forward unless the view
// under the pointer says otherwise: AppKit asks that one view's
// `acceptsFirstMouse(for:)`. Buttons, labels and tables say yes by
// themselves; plain views, image views, text views and web views say no.
// So each of those a click can land on answers true (search for
// "FirstClick.swift"), and SwiftUI gets `.allowsWindowActivationEvents()`
// at the root of each hosting view: RootView in ThreadbearApp, the composer
// card's collapse button and the review window. FirstClickTests walks the
// transcript's rows for any view that says no.

/// lands on the icon, not the row.
